<p>This game has no working title yet. My game follows two main characters: the Masked Man and Jeffrey, his dog.
  The pair starts out a seemingly-ordinary summer day with their daily walk, but disaster quickly strikes. The town gets 
  destroyed by mutants and monsters! After their house is burned down, M.M. and Jeffrey have no choice but to stop the threat 
  from terrorizing the residents further. The primary gameplay revolves around seeds that the smaller monsters drop upon death. M.M. and Jeffrey can collect seeds
  and plant them to grow the same monster out of the ground, and it will fight for them - players will have the option to switch between 
  the Masked Man and Jeffrey and whatever other monsters have been grown. As the game progresses, bigger monsters will require groups of grown monsters to take them down. If a character isn't being controlled by the player, it will fight
  automatically. The monsters will have different abilities and playstyles as well. Hopefully there will be a whole slew of monsters/enemies so the game
  doesn't get old too fast, but it also probably won't be very long. I know this is ambitious, but I'm remaining optimistic. </p>
